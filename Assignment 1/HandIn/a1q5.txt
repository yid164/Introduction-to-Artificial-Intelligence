1. Which algorithm used the most time to solve the problem:

    the most one is BFS and DFS, they are pretty similar time complexly,
    and the DFS spent more time as well

2. Which algorithm used the most memory to solve the problem:

    BFS, using 79% of my memory, then DFS using 76%

3. How often did your algorithms find an optimal solution:

    very few times, should be only 3 - 4 times

4. Did any algorithms run so long that you terminated them before they returned an answer?

    BFS, when I implement it spent a lot of time
