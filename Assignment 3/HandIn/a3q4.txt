1. How many of the problem problems did your implementation solve within the time limit?
    How does this compare to the previous implementation (A3Q3)
    1. it could solve 45-50 problems in LatinSquare and all problems in hard_example.txt

    2. To compare A3Q3, Q4 obviously faster than than A3Q3, and it could solve more problem,
        Also, save more time on the solving
